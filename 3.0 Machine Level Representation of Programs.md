### Introduction
Computers execute machine code, which is a sequence of bytes encoding low level operations.   
The compiler generates this machine code through a series of stages, based on the rules of the **programming language**, the **instruction set** of the target machine (aka CPU architecture) and the conventions followed by the **operating system**.

> Remember
> 
The GCC compiler generates its output in the form of **assembly code**, then invokes both an **assembler** and a **linker** to generate the executable machine code from the assembly code.   
Assembly is simply the textual representation of the binary machine code (to make it understandable for humans). It quite literally *is* the machine code itself but represented using words. 
>For example: `mov eax, ebx` instead of `89 D8`.
