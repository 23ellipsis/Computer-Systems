________
When a program runs, the OS provides the illusion that the program is the only one running on the system. The program appears to have exclusive use of the processor, main memory and I/O devices. (This concept will be illustrated more clearly later)  
The processor appears to be executing the instructions of the program one after another, and the code and data of the program appear to be the only objects in the system’s memory.

These illusions are provided by the notion of a **process**.

### What really *is* a process
A process is the operating system’s abstractions for a running program.

____
### Concurrency 
When two processes are running *concurrently* on a system, this means that the instructions of one processes are *interleaved* with the instructions of another process, giving the illusion of concurrency.  

> The CPU can execute only *one* instruction (per core) at a time. That's why concurrency is often described as an "illusion".

The OS performs this interleaving with a mechanism known as **Context Switching**.   
The OS first keeps track of all the state information that the process needs in order to run. This state, which is known as the **context**, includes information such as the current values of the PC (Program Counter, which is the register that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed), the register file, and the contents of the main memory which the process needs.  
When the operating system decides to transfer control from the current process to some new process, it performs a context switch by saving the context of the current process, restoring the context of the new process, and then passing control to the new process.

### Scenario
Consider a scenario where the user is running a simple `hello` program from the shell:  
- Initially, the shell process is running alone, waiting for input on the command line.
- When we ask it to run the `hello` program, the shell carries out our request by invoking a special function known as a **System Call** that passes control to the OS.
- The OS saves the shell’s context, then creates a new `hello` process and along with its context and passes control to it.
- After `hello` terminates, the OS restores the context of the shell process and passes control back to it, where it waits for the next command line input.

> Remember that all of this happens ***super fast*** that you won't even notice any latency.
________
### Threads
Although we normally think of a process as having a single control flow, but in a modern system a process can consist of multiple execution units called **threads**.
You can think of a thread as a linear flow of instructions, fetched and executed one by one. A process has one or more threads.
