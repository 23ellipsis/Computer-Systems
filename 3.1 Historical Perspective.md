### A Historical Perspective
This list includes some models of intel processors and their key features:

| **Era**               | **Processor(s)**                      | **Key Features**                                                                  | **Terms**                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Early x86**         | **8086** (1978)                       | First 16-bit CPU, 20-bit addressing (1MB), used in early IBM PCs                  | **Addressing**: how much memory the CPU can access                              |
|                       | **80286** (1982)                      | More complex (now obsolete) memory handling, used in early Windows PCs            |                                                                                 |
|                       | **i386** (1985)                       | First **32-bit**, introduced **flat memory model**, supported Unix/Linux          | **Flat memory model**: program sees one large memory space                      |
| **Performance Era**   | **i486** (1989)                       | Integrated **FPU** (floating-point math on chip), better performance              | **FPU**: Floating Point Unit: handles decimal math                              |
|                       | **Pentium → Pentium III** (1993–1999) | Faster CPUs, **SSE** for vector processing, improved instruction set              | **SSE**: SIMD instructions for handling multiple data in one operation          |
| **Modern x86-64 Era** | **Pentium 4** (2000)                  | Introduced **NetBurst** (high clock speed), **SSE2** with double-precision floats | **SSE2**: Enhanced SSE, supports larger floating-point types                    |
|                       | **Pentium 4E** (2004)                 | Added **hyperthreading** (2 threads per core), and **x86-64 (EM64T)** (64-bit)    | **Hyperthreading**: simulate 2 CPUs on 1 core  <br>**x86-64**: 64-bit extension |
|                       | **Core 2** (2006)                     | First **multi-core** Intel CPU (multiple cores per chip), dropped hyperthreading  | **Multi-core**: multiple CPUs in one chip                                       |
|                       | **Core i7** (2008)                    | Combined **multi-core + hyperthreading**, 2 threads per core, up to 4 cores       |                                                                                 |

### Notes
- Each seccessive processor has been designed to be backward compatible, meaning it’s able to run code compiled for any earlier version.
- Intel had serveral names for their processor line, inlcuding **IA32** (Intel Architecture 32 bit), and most recently **Intel 64** which is the 64 bit extension to IA32 (which is referred to as **x86_64**).
- AMD (Advanced MicroDevices) which is both a technology and a company is Intel’s main competitor in the market of x86 and x86_64 CPUs.
